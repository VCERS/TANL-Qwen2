Commercial 5,7,12,14-pentacenetetrone (Material) was obtained from TCI (Brand) and used as received for active materials (Recipe-target). 

The solid electrolytes Li7P3S11(LPS) glass ceramic (Material) used in this work was synthesized via a solid-state route (Synthesis-Apparatus) as reported elsewhere (Coref-of). 

Sulfide (Li2S, 99.9%, Alfa Aesar) (Nonrecipe-Material) and phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5, 99%, Aladdin) (Nonrecipe-Material) with a molar ratio of 70:30 were weighed and ground together (Operation). 

2 g of powder was loaded into a ZrO2 ball-mill jar (Apparatus-of) with 40 g of 5 mm diameter ZrO2 balls (Material). The jars were placed in Planetary Micro Mill (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch) (Apparatus-of) and milled for 30 h at 400 rpm (Condition-of) (Operation). (Condition-Unit) 10 minutes of milling was followed by 5 minutes breaks to dissipate heat (Condition-of) (Operation). 

The resulting powder was subsequently annealed at 210 °C for 3 hours and 250 °C for 1 hour with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 (Condition-of) and cooled to room temperature naturally (Condition-of) (Operation). 

All the above experiments were carried out under Ar atmosphere (Atmospheric-material).
