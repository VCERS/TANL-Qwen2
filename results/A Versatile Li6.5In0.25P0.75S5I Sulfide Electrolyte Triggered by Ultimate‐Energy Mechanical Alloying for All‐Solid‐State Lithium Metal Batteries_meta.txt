Li6PS5I glass-ceramic was synthesized via UEMA method. [Li6PS5I | Material | Recipe-target] The starting materials were [Li2S | Material | Nonrecipe-Material | Brand-of = Alfa Aesar], [P2S5 | Material | Nonrecipe-Material | Brand-of = Alfa Aesar], and [LiI | Material | Nonrecipe-Material | Brand-of = Aladdin]. [2 | Number | Number-of = g] [overall mass | Condition-Unit | Condition-of = mass] of [Li2S | Material], [P2S5 | Material], and [LiI | Material] with a molar ratio of [5 | Number | Number-of = :] [1 | Number | Number-of = :] [2 | Number | Number-of = ] were weighed and placed into a [zirconia jar | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained] (125mL) with [25 | Number | Number-of = zirconia balls | Material | Coref-of = contained] (10mm in diameter, overall mass = 75g). The mechanosynthesized process was conducted on the [mechanical alloying apparatus | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = operated] (Retsch, Emax) at 1200rpm for varying alloying times. To prevent high-temperature decomposition of samples due to rapid grinding, the milling equipment was fitted with a cooling system to keep the zirconia jar's temperature within 298â€“308K. Specifically, when the mechanical alloying time t = 0 min, the raw materials were evenly mixed in a mortar for 20 min. The traditional Li6PS5I crystal was synthesized through milling at 600rpm for 13h. The resulting precursors were pressed into pellets, sealed in a [quartz ampule | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained] and annealed at 873K for 2h. To ensure the complete reaction of the raw materials, the Li6PS5Br, Li6PS5Cl, and Li6.5In0.25P0.75S5I electrolytes were prepared via mechanical alloying at 1200rpm for 60min. The cathode in solid-state batteries consisted of [sublimed sulfur | Material], [vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) | Material], and [SSE | Material]. [S | Material], [VGCF | Material], and [SSE | Material] were mixed at a mass ratio of 7:1:2 by grinding at 300rpm for 1h. All preparation procedures were executed in an argon-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1ppm, O2< 0.1ppm).
