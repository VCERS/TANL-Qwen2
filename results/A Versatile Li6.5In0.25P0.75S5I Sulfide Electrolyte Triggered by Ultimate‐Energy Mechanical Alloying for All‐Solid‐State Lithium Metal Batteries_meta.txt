Li6PS5I glass-ceramic was synthesized via UEMA method. [Li6PS5I glass-ceramic | Material | Recipe-target] The starting materials were [Li2S (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) | Material | Recipe-precursor], [P2S5(99.9%, Alfa Aesar) | Material | Recipe-precursor], and [LiI (99.99%, Aladdin) | Material | Recipe-precursor]. [2 g | Number | Number-of] of [Li2S, P2S5, and LiI | Materials | Amount-of] with a [molar ratio of 5: 1: 2 | Condition-Misc] were weighed and put into a [zirconia jar (125mL) | Synthesis-apparatus] with [25 zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter) | Material | Coref-of] (overall mass = 75 g). The mechanosynthesized process was carried out on a [mechanical alloying apparatus (Retsch, Emax) | Apparatus-of] with [1200 rpm | Operation | Operation-of] for different [alloying time | Condition-of]. In order to avoid high-temperature decomposition of samples due to high-speed grinding, the [milling apparatus | Apparatus-of] was equipped with a [cooling machine | Apparatus-of] to maintain the temperature of the [zirconia jar | Apparatus-of] at [298â€“308 K | Condition-of]. In particular, when the [mechanical alloying time | Condition-of] = 0 min, the raw materials were mixed uniformly in a [mortar | Apparatus-of] for [20 min | Condition-of]. The traditional Li6PS5I crystal was synthesized via milling at [600 rpm | Operation | Operation-of] for [13 h | Condition-of]. The obtained [precursors | Material] were pressed into [pellets | Material], and then sealed in a [quartz ampule | Apparatus-of] and [annealed at 873 K | Condition-of] for [2 h | Condition-of]. For ensuring the adequate reaction of the raw materials, the [Li6PS5Br, Li6PS5Cl, and Li6.5In0.25P0.75S5I electrolytes | Materials] were prepared via mechanical alloying at [1200 rpm | Operation | Operation-of] for [60 min | Condition-of]. The cathode in solid-state batteries consisted of [sublimed sulfur, vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF), and SSE | Materials]. [S, VGCF, and SSE | Materials] were mixed at the [mass ratio of 7: 1: 2 | Condition-Misc] by grinding at [300 rpm | Operation | Operation-of] for [1 h | Condition-of]. All of the preparation processes were operated in an [argon-filled glove box | Apparatus-of] (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2< 0.1 ppm).
