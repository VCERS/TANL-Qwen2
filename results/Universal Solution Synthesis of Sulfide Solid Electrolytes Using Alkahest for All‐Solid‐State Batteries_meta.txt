For the solution synthesis of Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12:
- Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5and Na3PS4were prepared via ball milling and subsequent HT under an Ar atmosphere.
- Stoichiometric mixtures of precursor materials were used: EDA (98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), EDT (98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), ET (99%, Alfa-Aesar), Li2S (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar), P2S5(99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), LiCl (99.99%, Alfa-Aesar), GeS2(99.9%, American Elements), Na2S (Sigma-Aldrich), and SnS2(99%, MKN).
- Solutions were stirred at 60 °C for 3 h, except for EDT- and ET-Na11Sn2PS12, which were stirred at 70 °C.
- Syntheses were performed under an argon atmosphere.
- Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5and Na3PS4exhibited ionic conductivities of 4.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 9.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C, respectively.
- Na2S–NSPS–C nanocomposites were prepared by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of Na2S, SnS2, and P2S5powders in the EDA–EDT solvent and stirring at 70 °C for 3 h.
- Super C65 was added, and the solution was stirred.
- The target weight ratio of Na2S/Na11Sn2PS12/super C65 was 30:50:20.
- The solvent was removed at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum, and the as-obtained powders were subjected to HT at 700 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere.
- Mixture electrodes were prepared via conventional manual mixing of Na2S, NSPS (prepared by solid-state synthesis, 0.8 mS cm−1), and super C65, with a weight ratio of 30:50:20.
