For the solution synthesis of Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12:
- Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 and Na3PS4 were prepared using:
  - EDA (98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich)
  - EDT (98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich)
  - ET (99%, Alfa-Aesar)
  - Li2S (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar)
  - P2S5 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)
  - LiCl (99.99%, Alfa-Aesar)
  - GeS2 (99.9%, American Elements)
  - Na2S (Sigma-Aldrich)
  - SnS2 (99%, MKN)

Stoichiometric mixtures of these materials were added to the EDA–EDT mixture solvent and stirred at:
- 60 °C for 3 h for Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12
- 70 °C for EDT- and ET-Na11Sn2PS12

All synthetic procedures were conducted under an argon atmosphere.

Preparation of Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 and Na3PS4:
- For Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5:
  - Stoichiometric mixture of Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and LiBr was ball-milled at 600 rpm for 10 h in a ZrO2 vial with ZrO2 balls using a Pulverisette 7PL (Fritsch GmbH)
  - Then subjected to HT at 550 °C for 5 h under an Ar atmosphere
- For Na3PS4:
  - Stoichiometric mixture of Na2S and P2S5 was ball-milled at 500 rpm for 1 h in a ZrO2 vial with ZrO2 balls using a Pulverisette 7PL
  - Subsequently, subjected to HT at 270 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere

Ionic conductivities:
- Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5: 4.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C
- Na3PS4: 9.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C

Preparation of Na2S–NSPS–C nanocomposites:
- Stoichiometric amounts of Na2S, SnS2, and P2S5 powders were fully dissolved in the EDA–EDT solvent and stirred at 70 °C for 3 h
- Super C65 was added, and the solution was stirred
- Target weight ratio of Na2S/Na11Sn2PS12/super C65: 30:50:20
- Solvent was removed at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum
- As-obtained powders were subjected to HT at 700 °C for 12 h under an argon atmosphere

Mixture electrodes preparation:
- Na2S, NSPS (prepared by solid-state synthesis, 0.8 mS cm−1), and super C65 were mixed conventionally manually
- Weight ratio: 30:50:20
