Single-crystalline NCM811 sample without coating or doping modifications [was purchased | Operation | Recipe-target = purchased ] from [Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co. Ltd | Brand | Brand-of = purchased ] Lithium metal anode [ (200 µm thick) | Condition-Unit | Condition of = bought ] was bought from [China Energy Lithium Co. Ltd | Brand | Brand-of = bought ] LPSCl, Li7P3S11, and 0.7Li3PS4-0.3LiI [electrolyte powders | Material | Recipe-target = supplied ] were supplied by [Ganfeng Lithium Group Co. Ltd | Brand | Brand-of = supplied ] LGePS powder [was supported | Operation | Recipe-target = supported ] by [Guilin Electrical Equipment Scientific Research Institute Co. Ltd | Brand | Brand-of = supported ] LSnPS [electrolyte | Material | Recipe-target = synthesized ] was synthesized by [mechanical ball milling and annealing | Operation | Synthesis-apparatus = mechanical ball milling and annealing ] Li2S [ (99.98%, Sigma Aldrich) | Brand | Brand-of = weighed ] SnS2 [ (99.5%, Energy Chemical) | Brand | Brand-of = weighed ] and P2S5 [ (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) | Brand | Brand-of = weighed ] were weighed and put into a [zirconia jar (125 mL) | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained ] together with [25 zirconia balls | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained ] Mechanical milling was performed with a [milling machine (Fritsch, P7) | Apparatus-of = operated ] for [2 hours | Number | Number-of = performed ] at a speed of [580 rpm min−1 | Condition-unit | Condition-of = performed ] The mixed powder was pressed into pellets and then [sintered for 2 h at 873 K | Operation | Next-operation = powdered ] The sintered pellets were ultimately [powdered in a mortar | Operation | Next-operation = produced ] The LSnS [electrolyte | Material | Recipe-target = produced ] was produced via a [gas-phase synthesis route | Operation | Synthesis-apparatus = gas-phase synthesis route ] The [stoichiometric Li2CO3 (99.99%, Innochem) | Brand | Brand-of = hand-ground ] and [SnO2 (99.9%, Macklin) | Brand | Brand-of = hand-ground ] were hand-ground and transferred into an [alumina crucible | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained ] in a [tubular furnace | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained ] N2 with a [controlled flow rate | Condition-unit | Condition-of = passed ] was passed through CS2 liquid, thereby converting CS2 into gaseous reaction gas into a [tubular furnace | Synthesis-apparatus | Apparatus-of = contained ] The reactant was heated at [500 °C for 24 h | Condition-unit | Condition-of = heated ] and the product was ground to obtain [solid electrolyte powder | Material | Recipe-target = obtained ]
