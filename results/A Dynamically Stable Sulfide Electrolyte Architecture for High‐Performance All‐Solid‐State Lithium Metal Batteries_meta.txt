Single-crystalline NCM811 sample without coating or doping modifications [ Material ] was [ purchased | Operation | Next Operation = bought | : = Operation ] from Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. [ Lithium metal anode | Material ] ( [ 200 | Number | Number Of = µm ] [ µm | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = thick ] ) was [ bought | Operation | Next Operation = supplied | : = Operation ] from China Energy Lithium Co. Ltd. [ LPSCl | Nonrecipe-Material ], [ Li7P3S11 | Nonrecipe-Material ], and [ 0.7Li3PS4-0.3LiI | Nonrecipe-Material ] electrolyte powders were [ supplied | Operation | Next Operation = supported | : = Operation ] by Ganfeng Lithium Group Co. Ltd. [ LGePS | Material ] powder was [ supported | Operation | Next Operation = synthesized | : = Operation ] by Guilin Electrical Equipment Scientific Research Institute Co. Ltd. [ LSnPS | Material ] electrolyte was [ synthesized | Operation | Next Operation = weighed | : = Operation ] by mechanical ball milling and annealing. [ Li2S | Material ] ( [ 99.98% | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = Li2S ] , Sigma Aldrich ), [ SnS2 | Material ] ( [ 99.5% | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = SnS2 ] , Energy Chemical ), and [ P2S5 | Material ] ( [ 99.9% | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = P2S5 ] , Alfa Aesar ) were [ weighed | Operation | Next Operation = put | : = Operation ] and [ put | Operation | Next Operation = together | : = Operation ] into a zirconia jar ( [ 125 | Number | Number Of = mL ] ) [ together | Operation | Next Operation = with | : = Operation ] 25 zirconia balls. Mechanical milling was [ performed | Operation | Next Operation = pressed | : = Operation ] with a milling machine (Fritsch, P7) for [ 2 | Number | Number Of = hours ] at a speed of [ 580 | Number | Number Of = rpm ] [ min−1 | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = milling speed ] . The mixed powder was [ pressed | Operation | Next Operation = sintered | : = Operation ] into pellets and then [ sintered | Operation | Next Operation = ultimately powdered | : = Operation ] for [ 2 | Number | Number Of = hours ] at [ 873 | Number | Number Of = K ] . The sintered pellets were [ ultimately powdered | Operation | Next Operation = ultimately ground | : = Operation ] in a mortar. The LSnS electrolyte was [ produced | Operation | Next Operation = via | : = Operation ] a gas-phase synthesis route. The stoichiometric [ Li2CO3 | Nonrecipe-Material ] ( [ 99.99% | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = Li2CO3 ] , Innochem ) and [ SnO2 | Nonrecipe-Material ] ( [ 99.9% | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = SnO2 ] , Macklin ) were [ hand-ground | Operation | Next Operation = transferred | : = Operation ] into an alumina crucible in a tubular furnace. [ N2 | Nonrecipe-Material ] with a [ controlled flow rate | Condition-Type | Condition Of = N2 ] was [ passed | Operation | Next Operation = converted | : = Operation ] through CS2liquid, thereby converting CS2into gaseous reaction gas into a tubular furnace. The reactant was [ heated | Operation | Next Operation = ground | : = Operation ] at [ 500 | Number | Number Of = °C ] for [ 24 | Number | Number Of = hours ] , and the product was [ ground | Operation | Next Operation = obtained | : = Operation ] to obtain solid electrolyte powder.
