Stoichiometric raw materials (Li2S, P2S5, LiI, and SnS2) [were weighed | Operation | Next Operation = sealed | | = Operation] (total 1 g) and [sealed | Operation | Next Operation = placed | | = Operation] in zirconia ball milling pots. The mass ratio between the [mixture | Material-Descriptor | Descriptor Of = raw materials] and the zirconia ball was [1:40 | Number | Number Of = mass ratio]. [Low-speed ball milling (180 rpm for 2 h) | Operation | Next Operation = high-speed ball milling (510 rpm for 13 h)] was used to [fully mix | Operation | Next Operation = protected | | = Operation] the starting materials under [Ar gas atmosphere | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = ball milling]. This process was carried out using a [planetary ball milling apparatus | Apparatus-attr-of | Apparatus Of = ball milling]. The ball-milled product was then [pressed | Operation | Next Operation = sealed | | = Operation] into pellets and [sealed | Operation | Next Operation = treated | | = Operation] in quartz tubes for [postannealing treatment]. The [annealing condition was 450 °C/8 h in the muffle furnace | Condition-Type | Condition Of = treated]. The rate of increasing temperature was [fixed at 5 °C min−1 | Condition-Type | Condition Of = annealing]. After the annealing, the sample naturally [cooled down to RT | Condition-Type | Condition Of = sample]. It was noted that [S vacancy can be produced | Relation-Type | Coref-of = S vacancy] by partly replacing [P2S5 with SnS2 in the starting raw materials | Relation-Type | Coref-of = S vacancy], which can be represented by the following defect equation using Kröger–Vink notation: [equation]. Through reacting with other reactants, the S vacancy was [occupied | Relation-Type | Coref-of = S vacancy], while more Li atoms were introduced to keep the charge balance, increasing the solubility of Li+ ions in the crystal structure.
