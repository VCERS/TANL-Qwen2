Stoichiometric raw materials (Li2S, P2S5, LiI, and SnS2) were weighed (total [1 | Number | Number Of = g] [g | Amount-Unit | Amount Of = raw materials]) and sealed in zirconia ball milling pots. [zirconia ball milling pots | Synthesis-Apparatus | Apparatus Of = sealed] The mass ratio between the mixture and the zirconia ball was [1:40 | Number | Number Of = mass ratio]. Low-speed ball milling ([180 | Number | Number Of = rpm] [rpm | Operation-Unit | Unit Of = ball milling]) for [2 | Number | Number Of = h] [h | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = ball milling] was used initially to fully mix the starting materials. Afterward, high-speed ball milling ([510 | Number | Number Of = rpm] [rpm | Operation-Unit | Unit Of = ball milling]) for [13 | Number | Number Of = h] [h | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = ball milling] was conducted on the mixture. All ball milling processes were protected under [Ar gas | Atmospheric-material | Atmospheric Material Of = ball milling] atmosphere by using a [planetary ball milling apparatus | Apparatus-attr-of | Apparatus Attr Of = ball milling]. Then, the ball-milled product was pressed into pellets, and sealed in [quartz tubes | Synthesis-Apparatus | Apparatus Of = sealed] for post-annealing treatment. The annealing condition was [450 | Number | Number Of = °C] [°C | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = annealing] / [8 | Number | Number Of = h] [h | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = annealing] in a [muffle furnace | Synthesis-Apparatus | Apparatus Of = annealing]. The rate of increasing temperature was fixed at [5 | Number | Number Of = °C min−1] [°C min−1 | Condition-Unit | Condition Of = temperature increase]. After the annealing was completed, the sample naturally cooled down to [RT | Condition-Type | Condition Of = cooling]. It was noted that S vacancy can be produced by partly replacing P2S5 with SnS2 in the starting raw materials, which can be represented by the following defect equation using Kröger–Vink notation: [equation | Coref-of | Coref Of = defect equation]. Through reacting with other reactants, the S vacancy was occupied, while more Li atoms were introduced to keep the charge balance, increasing the solubility of Li+ ions in the crystal structure.
